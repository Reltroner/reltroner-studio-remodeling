# Selected Case Studies

---

## Case Study 1 — Client Portal Authentication Modernization & Same-Origin API Routing

**Project:** Skill-Wanderer Client Portal

**Role:** Full-Stack / Platform Engineer

**Stack:** Laravel 12, PHP 8.2+, Keycloak, OIDC, JWT RS256, JWKS, Cloudflare Workers, Cloudflare Tunnel, Next.js, Rancher/Kubernetes, GitHub Actions

**Production URL:** https://client.skill-wanderer.com

### Case

The Client Portal required a production-grade authentication and API routing modernization.

The backend needed to validate real Keycloak access tokens from two trusted realms:

```text
client-portal

skill-wanderer-admin
```

The required authentication boundary was strict:

```text
client-portal realm

→ accept valid access token when aud contains client-portal-be


skill-wanderer-admin realm

→ accept valid access token only when aud contains client-portal-be
  and realm role contains client
```

At the same time, the frontend needed to stop exposing the legacy browser-facing API base:

```text
https://api.skill-wanderer.com
```

and move to same-origin API access:

```text
https://client.skill-wanderer.com/api/*
```

The challenge was multi-layered:

* Keycloak tokens needed the correct backend audience
* Admin realm tokens needed role-based restriction
* Laravel needed JWKS-backed JWT validation
* Rancher needed a new backend deployment
* Cloudflare could not directly route `client.skill-wanderer.com/api/*` through Tunnel because the hostname was already managed by the frontend Worker
* The frontend dashboard initially did not send the Bearer token
* The backend dashboard route still used legacy session middleware instead of the new Keycloak token middleware

### Solution

I resolved the issue end-to-end across identity, backend, frontend, Cloudflare, and deployment layers.

#### Keycloak

Configured and validated access tokens so they contained the backend audience:

```json
"aud": ["client-portal-be", "account"]
```

For the `skill-wanderer-admin` realm, the token also needed:

```json
"realm_access": {
  "roles": ["client"]
}
```

This ensured the backend did not accept generic Keycloak tokens. It only accepted tokens explicitly intended for the backend resource server.

#### Backend

Implemented deterministic Keycloak JWT validation in Laravel:

* JWKS provider
* JWT validator
* Multi-issuer validation
* Audience validation
* Admin realm role validation
* `keycloak.token` middleware
* Keycloak principal extraction into request attributes

Production backend configuration included:

```text
KEYCLOAK_BASE_URL=https://sso.skill-wanderer.com
KEYCLOAK_ALLOWED_REALMS=client-portal,skill-wanderer-admin
KEYCLOAK_EXPECTED_AUDIENCE=client-portal-be
KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_REALM=skill-wanderer-admin
KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_REQUIRED_REALM_ROLE=client
```

#### Deployment

Deployed the backend to Rancher using the image:

```text
ghcr.io/skill-wanderer/client-portal-be:sha-4ab8871
```

Updated deployment metadata:

```text
BE_DEPLOYMENT_ID=client-portal-be-sha-4ab8871
```

#### Same-Origin API Routing

Because `client.skill-wanderer.com` was already owned by the frontend Worker, direct Cloudflare Tunnel path routing could not be used.

The solution was to add a Next.js API proxy route:

```text
app/api/[...path]/route.ts
```

This allows:

```text
https://client.skill-wanderer.com/api/*
```

to proxy internally to:

```text
https://client-portal-api.skill-wanderer.com
```

Final runtime variables:

```text
API_BASE_URL=https://client.skill-wanderer.com

NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://client.skill-wanderer.com

API_UPSTREAM_URL=https://client-portal-api.skill-wanderer.com
```

#### Frontend Dashboard Authorization

Fixed the frontend dashboard request so it sends:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

to:

```text
/api/v1/client/dashboard
```

#### Backend Dashboard Route Migration

The dashboard route originally used legacy authentication middleware:

```text
dashboard.audit
bearer.validate
session.load
rbac:client
```

It was migrated to:

```text
dashboard.audit
keycloak.token
```

The controller now reads the authenticated identity from:

```text
keycloak_principal
```

The route no longer requires `X-Session-Id` when a valid Keycloak Bearer token is present.

### Result

Final production validation:

```text
GET https://client.skill-wanderer.com/api/v1/client/dashboard

Authorization: Bearer <valid-token>

→ 200 OK
```

Response headers confirmed Laravel backend execution:

```text
x-powered-by: PHP/8.4.22
x-deployment-id: client-portal-be-sha-4ab8871
```

Final dashboard result:

```text
Welcome back

Email: test@reltroner.com

Role: AUTHENTICATED
```

**Impact:**

* Implemented production-grade Keycloak multi-realm token validation
* Enforced backend audience boundary with `aud=client-portal-be`
* Restricted admin realm access using realm role `client`
* Removed browser dependency on `api.skill-wanderer.com` as API base
* Enabled same-origin API access through `client.skill-wanderer.com/api/*`
* Migrated dashboard authorization from legacy session auth to Keycloak JWT auth
* Verified browser dashboard loads successfully with authenticated backend data
* Reduced authentication ambiguity across frontend, backend, Keycloak, Cloudflare, and deployment layers
* Produced a cleaner trust boundary and safer production authentication model

## Case Study 2 — Emergency SSO Domain Isolation for Production LMS

**Project:** Reltroner Learning Academy / Reltroner Identity

**Role:** Full-Stack / Platform Engineer

**Stack:** Cloudflare DNS, Cloudflare Tunnel, Keycloak, OIDC Authorization Code + PKCE, Cloudflare Pages, Next.js, Rancher/Kubernetes

**Production URLs:**

https://lms.reltroner.com

https://sso.reltroner.com

### Case

Reltroner Learning Academy previously used a shared Skill-Wanderer SSO domain:

```text
https://sso.skill-wanderer.com/realms/reltroner
```

This created a business and technical risk because Reltroner authentication traffic, OIDC issuer metadata, login redirects, and identity branding were mixed with another organization's SSO domain.

The requirement was clear:

> Reltroner must stop using the shared Skill-Wanderer SSO domain and move to its own SSO identity boundary.

Target authority:

```text
https://sso.reltroner.com/realms/reltroner
```

The challenge was that multiple systems shared the same Keycloak backend:

```text
sso.skill-wanderer.com
sso.chanhdao.vn
sso.reltroner.com
```

The migration therefore had to isolate Reltroner without breaking Skill-Wanderer or Chanhdao.

### Solution

I handled the migration end-to-end:

* Migrated `reltroner.com` DNS authority from Hostinger to Cloudflare
* Preserved critical DNS records for LMS, HRM, email, SPF, DKIM, DMARC, and Resend
* Investigated Cloudflare Tunnel routing and identified the correct active tunnel
* Removed an incorrect inactive tunnel binding that caused Cloudflare Error 1033
* Recreated `sso.reltroner.com` under the correct active Cloudflare Tunnel
* Routed `sso.reltroner.com` to the existing Kubernetes-hosted Keycloak service:

```text
http://keycloak.keycloak:8080
```

* Updated the Next.js LMS OIDC fallback configuration
* Updated Cloudflare Pages production environment variables
* Redeployed the LMS frontend
* Verified OIDC issuer metadata through `.well-known/openid-configuration`
* Tested login, callback, authenticated state, logout, and cross-domain isolation end-to-end

Final architecture:

```text
https://lms.reltroner.com

        |
        | OIDC Authorization Code + PKCE
        v

https://sso.reltroner.com/realms/reltroner

        |
        v

Cloudflare Tunnel: blog-skill-wanderer

        |
        v

http://keycloak.keycloak:8080

        |
        v

Keycloak Realm: reltroner
```

### Result

Final validation:

```text
issuer: https://sso.reltroner.com/realms/reltroner

skill-wanderer match: False
```

The production LMS now redirects correctly:

```text
https://lms.reltroner.com

→ https://sso.reltroner.com/realms/reltroner/protocol/openid-connect/auth

→ login success

→ callback to https://lms.reltroner.com/auth/callback

→ authenticated LMS session

→ logout success
```

Cross-system isolation was also validated:

```text
Skill-Wanderer → sso.skill-wanderer.com

Chanhdao      → sso.chanhdao.vn

Reltroner     → sso.reltroner.com
```

**Impact:**

* Completed emergency SSO migration end-to-end
* Removed Reltroner dependency on the shared Skill-Wanderer SSO domain
* Preserved existing Skill-Wanderer and Chanhdao production SSO flows
* Validated authentication through real user login/logout
* Improved identity boundary, production clarity, and operational ownership
* Demonstrated production-level debugging across DNS, Cloudflare Tunnel, Keycloak, OIDC, frontend configuration, and deployment layers

## Case Study 3 — Tradixa Retail Management System: ERP SaaS Architecture & Affiliate Enablement

**Project:** Tradixa Retail Management System

**Role:** ERP SaaS Business Architecture / Affiliate SaaS Enablement

**Focus:** Retail ERP, Inventory, Procurement, WMS, Sales, Finance, HRIS, Reports, Settings, AI Assistant, B2B SaaS sales communication

**Period:** 2026 – Present

**Product URL:** https://tradixasystems.com

### Case

Tradixa is a broad retail management SaaS with many interconnected modules:

```text
Inventory

Warehouse / WMS

Procurement

Customers & Marketing

Promotions

Sales

Financial & Operations

HRIS Management

Reports

Financial Agent

Settings

AI Assistant

Design Studio
```

The challenge was not only understanding the feature list.

The real challenge was translating a complex ERP SaaS into business language that potential B2B clients can understand.

Most retail/distribution clients do not buy “modules.”

They buy relief from operational pain:

* Stock is messy or often mismatched
* Sales and inventory are not connected
* Supplier purchases are not controlled
* Goods receipt and stock posting are not traceable
* Customer receivables are forgotten
* Supplier payables are unclear
* Cash, bank, QRIS, EDC, and payments are fragmented
* Reports are late, manual, or unreliable
* Owners cannot see profit, cashflow, stock health, and business risk clearly

The affiliate sales challenge was:

> How do we explain Tradixa as a business-control system, not merely a feature-heavy application?

### Solution

I mapped Tradixa's SaaS modules into a structured ERP architecture and business-value framework.

The work included:

* Mapping every major Tradixa module into realistic business architecture boundaries
* Defining each module's role in the business system, not only its UI function
* Connecting Inventory, WMS, Procurement, Sales, Finance, HRIS, Reports, Design Studio, Settings, and AI Assistant into an end-to-end retail operating model
* Translating technical modules into **Problem → Solution → Result** communication
* Identifying the highest-probability B2B client targets for affiliate sales
* Creating client pain-point mapping for retail, distributor, supplier, multi-location warehouse, payment point, and B2B seller segments
* Reframing Tradixa from “ERP features” into business outcomes:

```text
Stock control

→ fewer blind spots in inventory


Sales + payments

→ clearer revenue and settlement visibility


Procurement + GRN

→ controlled supplier purchasing and stock intake


AR/AP + Payments

→ clearer cashflow, receivables, and payables


Reports

→ owner-level decision visibility


Design Studio

→ professional business documents


AI Assistant

→ business insight layer
```

I also developed affiliate-facing positioning for offline and online B2B sales:

```text
Do not sell “complete ERP.”

Sell the specific pain the business already feels.
```

### Result

This work created a stronger bridge between software architecture and business realization.

**Business Realization Impact:**

* Converted complex ERP modules into client-readable business value
* Created a clearer affiliate sales narrative for B2B prospects
* Improved ability to explain Tradixa through concrete operational pain, not generic SaaS claims
* Built a reusable Problem → Solution → Result framework for sales conversations, demos, and client discovery
* Strengthened positioning for conversations with retail stores, distributors, B2B suppliers, payment points, and multi-location businesses
* Demonstrated the ability to reason across product architecture, business operations, and go-to-market execution

**Engineering Value:**

* Strengthened ERP domain understanding across inventory, sales, procurement, finance, WMS, HRIS, reporting, and settings layers
* Built module-boundary clarity that can support future backend/API design
* Identified realistic integration points between modules such as Sales → Inventory → Finance, Procurement → GRN → AP, and Reports → Decision Support
* Developed a business-aware engineering viewpoint: implementation is not enough unless the system solves real operational uncertainty

This case strengthened my profile beyond implementation engineering.

It demonstrates my ability to connect:

```text
software architecture

→ business process

→ client pain

→ SaaS positioning

→ measurable value narrative
```

The previous structure risked:

* Duplication
* Manual synchronization errors
* Stale data
* Hardcoded sitemap maintenance
* Difficult course expansion

### Solution

I helped transform the system into a modular architecture:

```text
Course

→ Module

### Case

A repository contained an exposed RSA test key, creating a potential security risk.

Even though there was no production compromise, the incident required controlled remediation to prevent future exposure and preserve repository safety.

### Solution

I handled the incident with a structured remediation process:

* Rewrote Git history using `git filter-repo`
* Removed all secret traces from the repository
* Force-pushed sanitized history safely
* Implemented preventive controls:

  * `.gitignore`
  * pre-commit hooks
  * secret hygiene workflow

### Result

# Recruiter Summary

I am a **Full-Stack / Platform Engineer with System Architecture and System Engineering capability** who can work across frontend, backend, code, architecture, authentication, IAM, infrastructure configuration, debugging, deployment validation, documentation, production verification, and ERP business-process reasoning.

My strongest fit is a team that needs an engineer who can handle not only implementation, but also the full reasoning chain:

```text
problem

→ root cause

→ architecture boundary

→ solution

→ production validation

→ business result

→ documentation
```

I am especially interested in full-stack, backend, platform, system architecture, SaaS, LMS, ERP, identity/authentication, and business systems engineering roles.

My current differentiator is that I can connect:

```text
engineering architecture

→ operational workflow

→ client pain

→ business value

→ implementation clarity
```

That means I do not only ask whether a system works technically.

I also ask whether the system:

* Solves a real business problem
* Has clear system boundaries
* Can be verified with evidence
* Can be maintained after deployment
* Protects critical identity and data boundaries
* Can be explained clearly to engineers, stakeholders, owners, and clients

Ultimately, my engineering approach is:

> **Reduce uncertainty → establish boundaries → build the solution → verify production behavior → communicate the business result.**
